# Fresh Eyes

Your AI coding agent is very sure it did a good job. Adorable. Maybe it's time for a second opinion?

Fresh Eyes asks a separate LLM to look at your work. The separate agent helps because ["LLM Evaluators Recognize and Favor Their Own Generations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13076). The clean slate (no prior history) helps because LLMs with history may remember the goal more clearly than the code itself.

It's pretty simple to use. `Look at this with fresheyes.`

## Install

Install the Fresh Eyes plugin in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add danshapiro/fresheyes
/plugin install fresheyes@danshapiro-fresheyes
```

Or Codex:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danshapiro/fresheyes.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R fresheyes/skills/fresheyes ~/.codex/skills/
```

And, Fresh Eyes needs either Claude Code or Codex CLI to work its magic. 

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest
```

GPT-6 Astra requires Codex CLI 0.153.1 or newer. Manual GPT reviews use GPT-6 Astra with Extra High reasoning by default; automatic reviews use Astra with Medium reasoning. Set `FRESHEYES_REASONING` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`) to change the manual-review reasoning level for either provider; a manual review at `high` reaches the same verdicts in noticeably fewer model calls, which matters when reviews run against a metered plan. Set `FRESHEYES_CODEX_IGNORE_USER_CONFIG=1` to launch the Codex reviewer with `--ignore-user-config`, so none of your `config.toml` (hooks, plugins, service tier, model overrides) reaches the review; leave it unset if your config.toml defines the model provider the reviewer needs. Set `FRESHEYES_VERSION_PROBE_TIMEOUT` (seconds, 20 by default) to change how long the prerequisite `codex --version` / `claude --version` probe may take before the launch fails with a named error; raise it on a slow host, and note that a probe that never answers at all is usually the CLI being blocked outside itself rather than a slow one. Astra is rolling out to Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans first; if the default errors for you on Plus, add `export FRESHEYES_GPT_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol` to your shell profile, and on Free or Go use `export FRESHEYES_GPT_MODEL=gpt-5.6-terra`, so both manual and automatic reviews use a GPT-5.6 model your plan includes.

Claude Fable 5.1 requires Claude Code 2.1.257 or newer. Manual Claude reviews use Fable 5.1 with Extra High reasoning by default; automatic reviews use Fable 5.1 with Medium reasoning. Fable 5.1 is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users, as well as through usage credits and API access.

The Claude reviewer runs read-only: it can read files and run `git diff`, `git show`, `git log` and `git status`, and it cannot edit files or run other programs. It does not load your Claude Code settings, hooks, plugins or MCP servers, so it needs a logged-in CLI; an `apiKeyHelper` or `env` block in `settings.json` is ignored.

Note that Claude reviews count against your Claude overage, not your subscription _(shakes fist at universe)_.

## How to do it:

Fresh Eyes reviews what Git can show it. So:

1. Commit the work you want reviewed.
2. Ask your agent to run Fresh Eyes.

Ask in normal language:

> Review this (plan, checkin, worktree, whatever) with fresh eyes.

Review and fix:

> Review this with fresh eyes and fix anything it finds. Repeat up to three times or until it passes.

(This is magic, and I do it all the time. Be sure to give it a limit or it could get stuck and burn all the tokens.)

For a specific folder:

> Do a security review of `src/auth/` with fresh eyes.

For a finished branch:

> Review this branch with fresh eyes, fix what comes up, and stop when it passes or after 5x turns.

For a specific reviewer:

> Review this with fresh eyes using Claude.

> Review this with fresh eyes using GPT.

You usually do not need to choose a reviewer. Fresh Eyes normally picks a different kind of model from the one already helping you. 

## What Happens Next

Your agent starts the review and waits for the result. A normal review can take a few minutes. Big branches and broad requests can take an hour.

Fresh Eyes returns a review with a clear result:

- `PASSED` means there are no blocking issues.
- `FAILED` means it found something worth fixing before you move on.

If it fails, fix the issues, commit again, and run Fresh Eyes again. If it passes, stop. A reviewer can always find small cleanup ideas if you keep asking, but a pass means the blocking problems are gone.

## When It Helps

I use Fresh Eyes most often in three places.

After writing a plan, to catch issues. 

After executing a plan (or making any sort of change), to find bugs.

Before merging, it gives the branch one more independent read.

## Optional Automatic Review

You can make Fresh Eyes run before every commit. 

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
bash ~/.claude/plugins/fresheyes/scripts/install-automatic-hook.sh
```

To skip the automatic review for one commit:

```bash
SKIP_FRESHEYES=1 git commit
```
